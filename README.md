The PuppetDB CLI project provide Puppet subcommands for querying PuppetDB data,
via `puppet query <query>`, and PuppetDB administrative tasks, `puppet db
<import|export|status>`. The `query` subcommand will allow you to query PuppetDB
using either the upcoming PQL syntax of the traditional PuppetDB query syntax
(also known as AST). The `db` subcommand is a replacement for the older
`puppetdb <export|import>` commands with faster startup times and much
friendlier error messages.

## Usage

Example usage:

~~~bash

    $ puppet-query '["from","reports",["extract","certname"]]'
    [{"certname":"host-1"}]
 
~~~

## Configuration

Example file to place at `~/.puppetlabs/client-tools/puppetdb.conf`:

~~~json

    {
       "puppetdb":{
                     "server_urls":"https://alpha-rho.local:8081",
                     "ca":"<path to ca.pem>",
                     "cert":"<path to cert .pem>",
                     "key":"<path to private-key .pem>"
                  }
    }

~~~

or to specify multiple PuppetDB servers for failover:

~~~json

    {
       "puppetdb":{
                     "server_urls":[
                                     "https://alpha-rho.local:8081",
                                     "https://beta-theta.local:8081",
                                   ],
                     "ca":"<path to ca.pem>",
                     "cert":"<path to cert .pem>",
                     "key":"<path to private-key .pem>"
                  }
    }

## Install from source

Make sure the appropriate version of leatherman is installed on your system.

~~~bash

      $ mkdir build
      $ cmake build
      $ make -C build -j2
 
~~~

if you don't want to install leatherman globally or need to build with a
different version of curl or openssl (looking at you OSX) you can use
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<paths to deps> cmake build` in the steps above.
